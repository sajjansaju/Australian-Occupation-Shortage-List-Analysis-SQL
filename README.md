**Q7 Identify if a shortage trend is improving or worsening over years for an occupation in Australia.**
```SQL
select year
	  ,count(*) as no_of_shortages
from occupationshortage
where national_shortage_rating in ('Shortage','Regional Shortage')
group by year
order by year
;
```
**Answer:**
The shortage trend for the analyzed occupation in Australia shows a significant **worsening trend** from 2021 to 2023, with the number of shortages steadily increasing from **170 shortages in 2021** to **289 in 2022** and further rising to **332 in 2023**. However, the trend shows a slight improvement in 2024, where the number of shortages decreases to **303**, indicating some stabilization in the labor market for this occupation. This suggests that while the shortage situation became more severe over the earlier years, efforts to address the issue might have started yielding results in 2024. 

The image below provides a visual representation of the shortage trend over the years:

**Q8 Is 'Registered Nurse' consistently one of the most in-demand jobs in the healthcare sector, based on national shortage ratings?**
```SQL
select year,
	   occupation
	   ,national_shortage_rating
from occupationshortage
where lower(occupation) like '%registered nurse%'
					and
	  national_shortage_rating ='Shortage'
order by 2 ,1	  
;
```
**Answer:**
The data confirms that 'Registered Nurse' is consistently one of the most in-demand jobs in the healthcare sector, as it has been marked with a **shortage rating** across multiple years (2022, 2023, and 2024) for various specialties. These include **Aged Care**, **Child and Family Health**, **Community Health**, **Critical Care and Emergency**, **Developmental Disability**, **Disability and Rehabilitation**, **Medical Practice**, **Mental Health**, and **Paediatrics**.

This consistent shortage highlights the critical and ongoing demand for registered nurses in Australia‚Äôs healthcare system.

**Q9 Is 'Analyst' consistently one of the most in-demand jobs based on national shortage ratings across years?**
```SQL
select year
	,anzsco
	,occupation
	,national_shortage_rating
from occupationshortage	
where lower(occupation) like '%analyst'
order by occupation,year;
```
**Answer:**
The data reveals that 'Analyst' roles exhibit mixed trends in terms of being in demand based on national shortage ratings across the years:

- **Cyber Security Analyst**: This role has consistently been marked with a **shortage rating** every year from **2021 to 2024**, highlighting its critical demand across industries.
- **Data Analyst**: Classified as having **no shortage** from **2021 to 2024**, indicating sufficient supply to meet labor market needs.
- **ICT Business Analyst**: Experienced a **regional shortage** in **2022 and 2024**, while having **no shortage** in other years.
- **Systems Analyst**: Faced **regional shortages** in **2022 and 2024**, but **no shortage** in other years.

This analysis indicates that while some specific analyst roles, such as **Cyber Security Analyst**, are consistently in high demand, others like **Data Analyst** show no significant shortages, suggesting varying trends within the 'Analyst' category.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the Australian Occupation Shortage List (OSL) provides valuable insights into the labor market trends across various occupations and regions from 2021 to 2024. Key findings include:

- **Consistent Shortages**: Roles like **Registered Nurse** and **Cyber Security Analyst** have consistently faced shortages, indicating critical demand in the healthcare and technology sectors.
- **Regional Variations**: Shortages vary significantly across states, with **Western Australia** and **Victoria** consistently recording the highest numbers of shortages.
- **Mixed Trends**: While some roles, such as **Data Analyst**, show no significant shortages, other specialized analyst roles exhibit varying levels of demand, reflecting diverse labor market dynamics.
- **Improving Trends**: Certain occupations, like those showing shortages in earlier years, display signs of improvement in 2024, suggesting that interventions may be addressing some labor market gaps.

This study highlights the importance of continuously monitoring labor market trends to address workforce demands effectively. The data-driven approach provides policymakers and organizations with actionable insights to guide decisions on training, immigration, and workforce planning.
